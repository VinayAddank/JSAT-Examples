# JSAT-Examples

This repo will contain most of the examples in the wiki pages of the [JSAT](https://github.com/EdwardRaff/JSAT) project! Feel free to email / send a pull request to add more examples! 

# How do I get started? 

Really just not used to Java? Here is the raw list to get started and run an example. This is a Java [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) project. It would be good for you to learn about Java in general and how maven projects work, but this sequence of steps should get you running. Once your more familure with Maven projects, the POM dependency information on the JSAT page is all you need to add JSAT to an existing (or new) maven project. But for this, I'm assuming you need to go from complete scratch. 

This project has some example datasets built in, and maven handles downloading JSAT when you try to run it. 

## Step 1, Install Java JDK! 

Firs step, go to Oracle and [install JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) for your operating system. 

## Step 2, Install Netbeans! 

You can use any editor you like for a maven project (all the major ones support them). You could even do comand line. But [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/downloads/) will sort it all out for you. The "Java SE" option should be good, or if you just want to be super-sure, pick the "All" option. 

## Step 3, download this project! 

Clone or download and unzip this project! The download link is right there in the top-right corner! Or if your super lazy, click [here](https://github.com/EdwardRaff/JSAT-Examples/archive/master.zip). 

## Step 4, open the project!

Obviously, startup Netbeans and go to the menue and click **File** and then **Open Project**. Now navigate to the JSAT-Examples project and open it! 

## Step 5, start running the examples! 

You should be good now! You can right click on any of the files under **Source Packages** and **com.edwardraff.jsatexamples**, and then click the **Run** option. You should see some output below. You've now run an example with JSAT! You can use this project file as a starting place to modify it for your needs / what you want to try.
